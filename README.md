# Interview AI Query Web App

A simple web application built with **Next.js (App Router)** that accepts natural language queries like:

> “Who are the best-rated dishwasher repair technicians in San Francisco, CA USA and what do they charge? How do I book?”

The app returns a synthesized list of technician listings from mock data, styled in a clean UI. Bonus: Each listing includes a custom **Neptune Score**.
